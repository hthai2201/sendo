# SFConnect Backend Weekly Progress Report

## Week 6: Order Service - Status Updates & Partner Flow

### Accomplishments

- **Order Status Management:**
  - Defined all possible order statuses (Pending, Processing, ReadyForDelivery, Shipped, Delivered, Canceled).
  - Implemented valid status transition logic in the service layer, enforcing role-based transitions.
  - Added repository method to update order status atomically.
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `PUT /orders/{id}/confirm-ready` (partner confirms order is ready for delivery)
  - `PUT /orders/{id}/confirm-delivery` (buyer confirms order is delivered)
  - `GET /orders` (admin only, list all orders)
  - All endpoints protected by JWT and role-based authorization.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:**
  - Updated documentation for new endpoints and status transitions.
- **Testing:**
  - Updated and extended unit and handler tests for status transitions and new endpoints.
  - All tests pass after interface and mock updates.

### Notes

- Status transitions are strictly enforced by role and current state.
- Admin can list all orders; partners and buyers can only act on their own orders.
- Ready for commission logic and inter-service communication in Week 7.
