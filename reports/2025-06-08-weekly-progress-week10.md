# SFConnect Backend Weekly Progress Report

## Week 10: Performance & DevOps Readiness

### Accomplishments

- **Database Indexing & Query Optimization:**
  - Reviewed and optimized SQL queries for all services using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
  - Added indexes to frequently queried columns (e.g., `user_id`, `product_id`, `status`) in users, products, orders, and order_items tables.
  - Confirmed improved query performance and reduced bottlenecks.
- **Caching Strategy Review:**
  - Audited Redis cache usage in product-service for cache-aside pattern and invalidation logic.
  - Confirmed that all frequently accessed product data is cached and invalidated on update/delete.
  - Considered cache eviction policies and ensured Redis config is suitable for production.
- **Docker Readiness:**
  - Reviewed and optimized Dockerfiles for all services (multi-stage builds, smaller images).
  - Verified that `docker-compose.yml` builds and runs all services, PostgreSQL, and Redis seamlessly.
  - Tested network communication between containers; all services can communicate as expected.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Added a robust GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/main.yml`) to build, test, and (optionally) deploy on every push to main.
  - Pipeline runs `go test ./...` for all services and can be extended for deployment.
- **Basic Load Testing:**
  - Used ApacheBench (`ab`) and Postman to hit key endpoints for user, product, order, and chatbot services.
  - Collected baseline performance metrics and confirmed system stability under moderate load.
  - Documented ab usage for future reference.

### Notes

- All services are production-ready from a DevOps perspective.
- CI/CD and Docker Compose are in place for easy deployment and testing.
- Ready for final documentation, reporting, and presentation in Weeks 11â€“12.
