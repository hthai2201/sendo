# SFConnect Backend Weekly Progress Report

**Week Ending: 2025-06-08 (Continued)**

## Week 4: Product Service - Core Features & Caching

### Accomplishments

- **Product Service Schema & Migration:**
  - Designed and implemented the `products` table with UUID primary key, partner_id, and all required fields.
  - Wrote SQL migration and ensured test/production schema consistency.
- **Go Project Structure:**
  - Mirrored user-service structure: models, repository, service, handler, cache, utils.
- **CRUD & Caching:**
  - Implemented repository with full CRUD for products.
  - Added Redis caching (go-redis v9) with cache-aside pattern for product details.
- **Business Logic:**
  - Service layer integrates DB and cache, handles create, update, get, list, delete.
- **API & Auth:**
  - Gin HTTP handlers for all endpoints.
  - JWT middleware and role-based authorization (partner/admin for mutating endpoints).
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for service logic (mock repo/cache).
  - Integration tests for all API endpoints using a real test DB and Redis.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:**
  - Authored OpenAPI YAML for all endpoints and models.
- **DevOps:**
  - Dockerfile, .env.example, and Compose compatibility.

### Challenges & Solutions

- **JWT/Role Middleware:**
  - Reused and adapted user-service JWT parsing and role middleware for product-service.
- **Cache Consistency:**
  - Ensured cache invalidation on update/delete and cache population on read-miss.

### Next Steps

- Begin Week 5: Order Service (schema, CRUD, business logic, API, tests, Swagger docs, inter-service comms).
- Continue integration and coverage improvements.
