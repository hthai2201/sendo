# SFConnect Backend Weekly Progress Report

## Week 5: Order Service - Order Creation & Basic Flow

### Accomplishments

- **Order Service Schema & Migration:**
  - Designed and implemented the `orders` and `order_items` tables with all required fields.
  - Wrote SQL migration and ensured schema consistency.
- **Go Project Structure:**
  - Mirrored previous service structure: models, repository, service, handler, utils.
- **Repository & Business Logic:**
  - Implemented repository with full CRUD for orders and order items.
  - Service layer handles order creation, total calculation, and atomic DB operations.
  - Product price fetching is mocked for now (to be replaced with inter-service call later).
- **API & Auth:**
  - Gin HTTP handlers for order creation (`POST /orders`), order retrieval, and listing for user.
  - JWT middleware for authentication.
- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for service logic (mock repo).
  - Integration tests for API endpoints using a test DB (order creation, listing, retrieval).
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:**
  - Documented all endpoints and models in Swagger YAML.
- **Docker:**
  - Service builds and runs in Docker Compose with PostgreSQL.

### Notes

- All code compiles and tests pass.
- Order creation is atomic and status is set to "Pending".
- Ready for status management and partner/buyer flows in Week 6.
