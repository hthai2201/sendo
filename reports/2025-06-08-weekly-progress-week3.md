# SFConnect Backend Weekly Progress Report

**Week Ending: 2025-06-08**

## Overview

This week focused on completing the user-service core features, ensuring robust authentication, authorization, and profile management, and delivering full integration test coverage. The groundwork for the next phase (product-service) is now in place.

## Accomplishments

### 1. User-Service: Core Features & Testing

- **Registration, Login, JWT:**
  - Implemented secure registration and login endpoints with password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT-based authentication.
- **Profile Management:**
  - Added endpoints for profile retrieval and update, protected by JWT middleware.
- **Role Management:**
  - Implemented admin-only endpoint for updating user roles, with role-based authorization.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Consistent JSON error responses and robust error handling throughout all handlers.
- **Swagger/OpenAPI:**
  - Integrated swaggo/swag for API documentation, with all endpoints and models documented and UI available at `/swagger/index.html`.
- **Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - Unit tests for password, JWT, and service logic (all passing).
  - **Integration tests** for all API endpoints using a real test database, covering registration, login, profile, and admin role management. All tests passing after schema and test fixes.

### 2. DevOps & Environment

- **Docker Compose:**
  - PostgreSQL and Redis services running via Docker Compose.
  - User-service container builds and starts successfully.
- **Migrations:**
  - Ensured test and production DB schemas match, with UUID primary keys and correct extensions.

## Challenges & Solutions

- **UUID Generation in Tests:**
  - Resolved issues with UUID generation by running the same SQL migration as production in integration tests, rather than relying on GORM.
- **Role-based JWT:**
  - Ensured JWT tokens reflect updated roles by re-logging in after DB role changes in tests.

## Next Steps

- Finalize and submit this report.
- Begin implementation of product-service: schema, CRUD, Redis caching, business logic, API, tests, and Swagger docs.
- Continue to order-service and inter-service communication as per requirements.

## Blockers/Requests

- None at this time. All planned user-service features and tests are complete and passing.
